# 🎵 Spotify Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores Spotify's music dataset to analyze various aspects of songs, including popularity, audio features, and other metadata. By leveraging Python and data visualization tools, we uncover trends in music, the relationship between song features and popularity, and other interesting insights.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – Data handling and preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information on thousands of songs available on Spotify, with key attributes such as:
| Feature           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Track Name**   | Name of the song |
| **Artist**       | Artist(s) who performed the song |
| **Popularity**   | Spotify's popularity index (0-100) |
| **Danceability** | Measures how suitable a track is for dancing (0-1) |
| **Energy**       | Represents the intensity and activity of the track (0-1) |
| **Key**         | The musical key of the track |
| **Loudness**     | The overall loudness in decibels (dB) |
| **Mode**        | Indicates whether the song is in a major or minor key |
| **Speechiness**  | Detects spoken words in a track (higher values indicate more speech-like audio) |
| **Acousticness** | Likelihood of a track being acoustic (0-1) |
| **Instrumentalness** | Predicts whether a song has no vocals (higher values indicate instrumental tracks) |
| **Liveness**     | Detects the presence of a live audience (higher values indicate live performances) |
| **Tempo**       | Speed of the song in beats per minute (BPM) |
| **Duration (ms)** | Length of the track in milliseconds |
| **Time Signature** | The number of beats per bar in a track |
